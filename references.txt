This endpoint retrieves the Landsat 8 image for the supplied location and date. The response will include the date and URL 
to the image that is closest to the supplied date. The requested resource may not be available for the exact date in the

endpoint. The assets endpoint no longer returns a list of potential images within your date range due to a change on the 
Google Earth Engine API side.
